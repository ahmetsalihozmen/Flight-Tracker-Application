# Flight Tracker Application

- This program simulates theflights between the major capitals, such as New York, Sydney, Paris, Tokyo, Istanbul etc. around the world. 

- System includes at least 10 routes between 5 major capitals from different continents. 

The user would also add new capitals as well as new destinations to the
system. In addition to that, the user could delete and update existing destinations via
the GUI. Besides, the user should declare the flight details, such as the weekdays, the
departure and arrival times, the aircraft model, the flight number and the name of the
airlines. All the information should be saved into the related files.
Your system will have a system date, and one second in your system would represent one
minute in the real life. You would be able to start, pause, resume and stop the time of
your system. The scheduled flights would be simulated regarding to the system time.
Each capital would have a control tower to manage take offs and landings. For example,
the tower manager would set some delay for a scheduled flight or she/he could cancel
certain flights or even make the aircrafts, which are close to the related tower, wait in
the air.
